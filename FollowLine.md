# 0. INTRODUCTION

For this second project, the objective was to program a control algorithm for a **formula 1** car. To achieve this, the car had to detect, using a forward-facing color camera, a red line in the center of the lane and follow it. We had to implement code that processed the images returned by the camera to be able to follow the red line painted on the lane. Additionally, we had to program a control command generator for the linear and angular velocities through a PID in order to steer the car to the finish line in the shortest time possible. Moreover, as a special case, we could implement an extra behavior so that when the car lost the line, it could find it again.
