# 0. INTRODUCTION

For the first practice of this course, the objective was to program an exploration algorithm for a low-end vacuum cleaner. To accomplish this, we had access to laser sensors and the bumper, as we could not use the robot's localization or the map of the environment (in this case, a house). It had to be implemented using a properly defined state machine and being a reactive system, meaning avoiding loops and calls to sleep functions to prevent blocking the main execution flow. Additionally, the requirement, as previously inferred, was to cover the maximum space possible while avoiding getting stuck in just one area of the house.
